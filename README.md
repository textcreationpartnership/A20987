it ſelfe ſo long a time?

      * Q. Wherefore is it, that wee ſee not the element all fire which is above the ayre, as we doe here below the materiall fire, ſeeing that according to the Philoſophers, it is ten times more vaſt then the ayre, and yet wee ſee the Starre• of the heavens which are above it?

    _ Fevers.

      * Q. WHerefore is it, that thoſe which are furious by the ex•eame fits of a burning Fever, are •o very ſtrong and robuſt during •heir fury, and a little after be•ome extreamely weake and lan•uiſhing, when the fit is paſt?

      * Q. From whence comes it, that in winter, which is the moſt coldeſt ſeaſon of the yeare, burning fevers reigne moſt; and on the contrary the ſhaking fits are moſt rigorous to the aguiſh?

      * Q. But what produceth it yet more contrary effects, for it makes the raine to iſſue out of the veſſell, without any knowne paſſage whatſoever, according to Lucretius:

fruits, and ſuch as are moſt tender, little, and furtheſt from their maturity and perfection, are in ſo much the more bitter?

      * Q. Wherefore is it, that vulgarly they hold, that after raw fruite they muſt be temper'd with drinking wine?

    _ Froſt.

how then are they ſharpe▪ and ſowre; nevertheleſſe we are not ſo fully pleaſed with the ſweete, as with thoſe which have ſome little pricking of ſharpneſſe?

      * Q. Wherefore is it, that the ſick become ordinarily without taſte?

      * Q. Wherefore is it, that Oyle ſwimmeth above all other liquors, except upon Aqua vitae?

      * Q. But why? if oyle for being more fat, holds him ſo above the other liquors, how is it that it ſwimmes alſo upon greaſe it ſelfe, againſt that Axiome of the Phyſitians, who hold, that which is ſuch by the meanes of another, the ſame is yet more ſuch: If then

oyle is ſo light that it ſwimmes upon all other liquors, becauſe of his fatneſſe, it muſt bee that fatnes it ſelfe ſhould ſwimme upon the oyle?
